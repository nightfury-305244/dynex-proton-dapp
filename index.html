        "The Dynex Platform stands at the forefront of this technological evolution, harnessing the principles of neuromorphic dynamics to revolutionize the way we solve discrete optimization, sampling, and machine learning dilemmas. At its core, Dynex employs a groundbreaking technique known as neuromorphic annealing to explore and unearth solutions to the most complex problems. This approach diverges fundamentally from traditional computing methodologies, capitalizing on the inherent tendencies of real-world physical systems to seek out low-energy states. The orchestration of computing tasks is meticulously managed through the in-house Dynex Mallob system, distributing work among all participants. Miners, who contribute their computational prowess, receive rewards in the form of block rewards, transaction fees within a block, block fees facilitated by Dynex's customers, and the coveted solution reward, generously bestowed upon the miner who successfully completes the computational task first. Dynex is committed to forging a brighter future through the fusion of cutting-edge technology and groundbreaking computational solutions.",

An Order may set out the amount to be credited to the Balance in any one of the following ways:\n\n\u003cp1\u003e\n\u003csp\u003e\nExpressly providing the amount of the credit;\n\u003c/sp\u003e\n\u003csp\u003e\nProviding a certain quantity of access to one or more Services (excluding any Services to which Section 4.3(c) applies) in units other than credits (e.g. in units of time), in which case the amount to be credited to the Balance is equal to the amount the Customer would be debited for consuming that quantity of the one or more Services in its entirety; or\n\u003c/sp\u003e\n\u003csp\u003e\nProviding for “Up to” a certain quantity of access for a Service, in which case the total amount to be credited to the Balance is equal to the amount that Customer would be debited for consuming that quantity of that Service alone (the “Single Service Amount”); if multiple Services are described this way, only the greatest Single Service Amount will apply.\n\u003c/sp\u003e\n\u003csp\u003e\nIf an Order sets out the amount to be credited in more than one of the above ways, then only the greatest one applies. Dynex will debit the Balance as Customer uses the Services based on the rate for each Service as set out in the Order or, where no such rate is set out, at Dynex’s then-current rate for the applicable Service. Rates for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective as soon as Dynex posts updated rates on the Dynex Marketplace website or otherwise provides notice of such Service’s rates to Customer. Dynex may increase rates for any existing Services set out in an Order by giving Customer at least 30 days’ prior notice. Any unused portion of the Balance may not be carried over from one month to another, has no cash value, and is not refundable.\n\u003c/sp\u003e\n\u003c/p1\u003e\n\u003c/p1\u003e\n\n\u003cp2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e4.4 Usage\u003c/h2\u003e The Services are subject to usage limits, including the limits set out in an Order, the Service descriptions, and Documentation (e.g. number of API calls, number of results, number of computing systems or computing equipment, units of time, rates for use). Customer acknowledges that Dynex may monitor Customer’s usage of the Services and if Customer exceeds the applicable usage limits, including by depleting the Balance, then Customer may be required to purchase additional resources or services. If the necessary additional resources or services are not purchased by Customer then Dynex may suspend Customer’s access to the Services. Where the usage limit for Computing Services is set out in units of time (such as hours), Dynex will debit Customer’s Balance for use on a “per second” basis or, if it benefits Customer, on such other more-precise basis as Dynex may determine from time to time in its sole discretion.\n\u003c/p2\u003e\n\n\u003cp1\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e4.5 Prohibited Uses\u003c/h2\u003e Except with Dynex\'s prior written consent, which may be withheld by Dynex in its sole discretion, Customer will not engage, directly or indirectly, in any of the following acts (the "Prohibited Uses"):\n\n\u003cp1\u003e\n\u003csp\u003edecompile, extract, translate, decrypt, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer, create improvements, modifications or derivative works of, any portion of the Dynex Software or any other Dynex IP, or attempt to do any of the foregoing, except to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law despite this contractual prohibition on such activity, in which case Customer will give Dynex a detailed, written notice at least 30 days prior to engaging in such activity that describes the nature and extent of the contemplated activity.
